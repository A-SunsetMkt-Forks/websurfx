* Goals for future development

- Replace Handlebars with the faster templating engine /Tera/.
  
- Add more upstream search engines.
  
- Implement dorking support (like Google).
  
- Add advanced search functionality and a dropdown menu for it.
  
- Add more categories to the search engine's search page, such as images, files, news, and maps.
  
- Add advanced image functionality for content creators, video editors, etc.
  
- Add GPT integration, taking inspiration from the Langchain module of Python or incorporating it using pyo3, and give users the choice to add an API key. Giving users the choice is important, as some people may be against AI, and this will ensure that those users who don't want to use GPT can disable it by not adding an API key.
